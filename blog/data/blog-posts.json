      "content": "## Introduction\n\nSeen a ₹50,000 laptop for ₹15,000? A designer bag for 90% off? **If it seems too good to be true, it probably is**. Online shopping scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated in 2025. This guide will teach you how to spot fake discounts and shop safely.\n\n## Common Fake Discount Tactics\n\n### 1. The Inflated Original Price Trick\n\n**How It Works:**\n- Seller lists a product at ₹10,000 (marked up from real ₹6,000 value)\n- Shows \"50% OFF - Now ₹5,000\"\n- You think you're getting a great deal\n- Reality: You're paying below market price, but not getting the advertised discount\n\n**How to Spot:**\n- Check price history on sites like Keepa, CamelCamelCamel\n- Compare prices across 3-4 different platforms\n- Look at competitor pricing\n- Check offline store prices\n\n### 2. Limited Time Pressure\n\n**Red Flags:**\n- \"Only 2 hours left!\"\n- \"Last 3 pieces remaining!\"\n- Countdown timers that reset when you refresh\n- \"Sale ending tonight\" (but continues for weeks)\n\n**Reality Check:**\n- Most major sales run for 7-10 days\n- If stock is genuinely low, product will sell out\n- Real urgency doesn't need aggressive countdown timers\n\n### 3. The Minimum Order Value Trap\n\n**Example:**\n- \"Get ₹500 off on orders above ₹2,000\"\n- Items priced at ₹1,999 to force you to buy more\n- The \"discount\" is often less than buying items individually during regular sales\n\n**Smart Move:**\n- Calculate per-item cost\n- Check if you actually need additional items\n- Sometimes paying full price for one item is cheaper\n\n### 4. Fake Reviews & Ratings\n\n**Warning Signs:**\n- All 5-star reviews posted on same date\n- Generic praise (\"Great product!\", \"Value for money\")\n- Reviews with poor grammar/similar writing style\n- No verified purchase badge\n- Reviewers with only 1-2 reviews\n\n**How to Verify:**\n- Read 3-star reviews (most honest)\n- Check reviews on multiple platforms\n- Look for detailed reviews with photos\n- Use Fakespot or ReviewMeta to analyze authenticity\n\n## Red Flags Checklist\n\n### Discount-Related Red Flags\n\n- [ ] Discount over 70% on branded items\n- [ ] \"Original price\" seems unrealistically high\n- [ ] No historical pricing data available\n- [ ] Discount percentage keeps changing\n- [ ] MRP tag missing or looks fake\n\n### Seller-Related Red Flags\n\n- [ ] Seller rating below 4.0 stars\n- [ ] Newly registered seller account\n- [ ] No return/refund policy\n- [ ] Contact information missing\n- [ ] Only accepting prepaid orders\n\n### Product-Related Red Flags\n\n- [ ] Product description has typos\n- [ ] Images look like stock photos\n- [ ] No detailed specifications\n- [ ] Brand name slightly misspelled\n- [ ] \"Imported\" without origin details\n\n## Tools to Spot Fake Discounts\n\n### Browser Extensions\n\n**1.
